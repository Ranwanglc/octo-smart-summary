-- Scheduled summary binding & dedup integrity.
--
-- 1) One-to-one live binding between a task and its schedule.
--    live_schedule_id is a STORED generated column that equals schedule_id only
--    while the task is live (not soft-deleted) and actually bound; otherwise
--    NULL. A UNIQUE key over it therefore guarantees a schedule is bound to at
--    most one live task, while soft-deleted / unbound tasks (NULL) are exempt
--    from the constraint. The API maps a 1062 on this index to a clean 409.
--
--    Existing databases may already contain two or more *live* (not soft-deleted)
--    tasks bound to the same schedule_id. Once the generated column is added they
--    would all compute the same non-NULL live_schedule_id and the UNIQUE key
--    would fail to build. So first collapse such duplicates to a single winner:
--    keep the most recently updated live task per schedule_id (largest
--    updated_at, tie-break largest id) and unbind the rest (schedule_id = NULL)
--    so they fall into the NULL-exempt set. Unbinding (not deleting) preserves
--    the historical task rows and their summaries.

-- 2) A participant is unique per (task, user). The worker upserts the creator
--    participant with ON CONFLICT(task_id,user_id) DO NOTHING, which requires
--    this unique key to exist.
--
--    Existing databases may already contain duplicate (task_id,user_id) rows
--    created before this constraint existed (CreateSummary did not de-dup
--    non-creator participants). Adding the UNIQUE key directly would fail on
--    such data, so first collapse duplicates to a single best row, keeping the
--    participant that actually carries a personal result (completed/submitted or
--    non-empty content); among content-bearing rows keep the largest id, else
--    fall back to MIN(id). Dependent personal-result / chunk / source rows of
--    the discarded participants are removed in the same statement.
